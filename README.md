# <30 Server View
### Welcome to the Repo! 

### Description
I designed <30 to be a creative writing app where users receive the same random 30 words for the day and write poems. In development I shifted the design to have 30 random words every time the word list is rendered. From the random list a user can add words to thier poem.
